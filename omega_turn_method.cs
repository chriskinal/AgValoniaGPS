    /// Generates an Omega turn path using Dubins path generation.
    /// Matches legacy CreateABOmegaTurn and CreateCurveOmegaTurn logic from CYouTurn.cs.
    ///
    /// Algorithm (from legacy CYouTurn.cs lines 241-445 and 837-940):
    /// 1. Entry point is the end of the current track
    /// 2. Goal position is calculated based on turn offset (tool width - overlap) * rowSkips
    /// 3. Goal heading is inverted (180Â° from entry) for the U-turn
    /// 4. Dubins path connects entry to goal with smooth curves (RSR or LSL depending on turn direction)
    /// 5. Points are spaced based on turning radius (radius * 0.1 default in legacy)
    /// 6. Waypoints too close together are removed (distance squared < pointSpacing)
    /// 7. Boundary collision is checked and path adjusted if needed (handled by caller via BoundaryGuidedDubinsService)
