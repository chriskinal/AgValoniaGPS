# AgValoniaGPS Mission Document

## Product Vision

AgValoniaGPS represents the next evolution of precision agriculture guidance software, building upon the proven functionality of AgOpenGPS while embracing modern, cross-platform technology to serve farmers worldwide regardless of their operating system preferences.

## Core Principles

### Development Philosophy
- **Clean Architecture First**: No wholesale copying of code from the original AgOpenGPS. The legacy codebase serves as a feature reference and behavioral specification, not a source for direct code reuse.
- **Cross-Platform by Design**: Every feature must work seamlessly across Windows, Linux, and macOS from day one.
- **Modern Patterns**: Embrace current software engineering best practices including dependency injection, MVVM/MVP patterns, and comprehensive testing.
- **Cloud-Connected**: Native integration with AgShare for field data sharing and collaboration.

### Problem Statement

The agricultural technology landscape is evolving rapidly:
- **Platform Lock-in**: Current AgOpenGPS is Windows-only, limiting adoption among farmers using Linux or macOS
- **Aging Architecture**: Windows Forms technology is becoming obsolete and difficult to maintain
- **Limited Collaboration**: Farmers need better tools for sharing field data and guidance lines
- **Mobile Integration**: Growing demand for tablet and mobile device support in the field
- **Hardware Diversity**: Need to support expanding range of GPS receivers and agricultural hardware
