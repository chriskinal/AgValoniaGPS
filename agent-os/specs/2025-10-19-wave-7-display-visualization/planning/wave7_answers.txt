 Clarifying Questions for Wave 7: Display & Visualization

  Based on analysis of the legacy AgOpenGPS code and existing AgValoniaGPS implementation, I have the following questions:

  1. Unit System Support

  I assume we'll support both Metric (km/h, m, ha) and Imperial (mph, ft, ac) unit systems, similar to the legacy code. Should we also support mixed
  units (e.g., mph with metric area) or just pure metric/imperial modes? Yes metric and imperial. No mixed use.

  2. Speed Precision

  The legacy code uses dynamic precision - 1 decimal place for speeds >2 km/h, 2 decimal places for â‰¤2 km/h. Should we keep this pattern to reduce
  "noise" at low speeds, or use consistent precision? Continue with current precision method.

  3. GPS Quality Color Coding

  I found these quality-to-color mappings in legacy code:
  - RTK Fixed (4) â†’ PaleGreen
  - RTK Float (5) â†’ Orange
  - DGPS (2) â†’ Yellow
  - All others â†’ Red

  Should we use these same color mappings, or would you prefer different visual indicators for quality levels? The current mappings are fine.

  4. Heading Display Formats

  Legacy code shows heading in degrees with the Â° symbol (e.g., "45.2Â°"). Should we also support cardinal directions (N, NE, E, etc.) or stick with
  degrees only? Degrees only.

  5. Time Formatting

  For "time remaining" estimates, should we format as:
  - Hours and minutes (e.g., "2h 15m")? No
  - Decimal hours (e.g., "2.25 hr")? Yes
  - Or both depending on duration? No

  6. Localization & Culture

  The legacy code uses CultureInfo.InvariantCulture for most number formatting. Should we support locale-specific number formatting (e.g., comma vs
  period for decimals), or keep it culture-invariant for consistency? Keep invariantCulture.

  7. Formatter Service Organization

  I see FieldStatisticsService already has basic formatters. Should we:
  - Expand FieldStatisticsService with all display formatters? No
  - Create separate formatter services (e.g., SpeedFormatterService, GpsQualityFormatterService)? No
  - Create one unified DisplayFormatterService? Yes

  8. Performance Requirement

  The spec mentions <1ms for all formatting operations. This should be easily achievable for string formatting. Should formatters cache unit conversion
   factors, or is straightforward calculation acceptable? Straight forward calculation.

  9. Explicit Exclusions

  What should we explicitly exclude from Wave 7? For example: UI-specific rendering logic, OpenGL display code, actual color objects (we'd return color
   identifiers, not UI framework color objects), etc. Wiring the backend to the frontend will be a separate body of work.
