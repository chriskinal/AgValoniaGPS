# Task 4: FieldStatisticsService Expansion

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #4 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-19-wave-7-display-visualization/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Expand the existing FieldStatisticsService with Wave 7 display functionality including rotating display data generation, application statistics calculation, field name retrieval, and active guidance line information retrieval.

## Implementation Summary
This implementation expands the FieldStatisticsService (previously created in Wave 5) with four new methods to support the rotating display feature and application statistics. The service now provides structured data for three rotating display screens: application statistics, field name, and guidance line information. The implementation preserves all existing Wave 5 functionality (FormatArea, FormatDistance, boundary calculations) while adding the new Wave 7 capabilities. All methods return safe defaults when dependencies (field management, guidance line services) are not yet available, allowing the service to function independently during development.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS.Services/IFieldStatisticsService.cs` - Interface defining all FieldStatisticsService methods (existing Wave 5 + new Wave 7)

### Modified Files
- `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS.Services/FieldStatisticsService.cs` - Added Wave 7 methods and interface implementation, preserved existing Wave 5 methods

### Deleted Files
- `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS.Models/Display/GuidanceLineType.cs` - Removed duplicate enum (already exists in Models.Guidance namespace)

## Key Implementation Details

### IFieldStatisticsService Interface
**Location:** `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS.Services/IFieldStatisticsService.cs`

Created comprehensive interface defining all service methods:
- Existing Wave 5 properties and methods (WorkedAreaSquareMeters, BoundaryAreaSquareMeters, UpdateBoundaryArea, CalculateOverlap, GetRemainingAreaHectares, GetRemainingPercent, GetEstimatedTimeToFinish, GetWorkRatePerHour, Reset, FormatArea, FormatDistance)
- New Wave 7 methods (CalculateApplicationStatistics, GetRotatingDisplayData, GetCurrentFieldName, GetActiveGuidanceLineInfo)

**Rationale:** Creating an explicit interface enables dependency injection, improves testability, and provides a clear contract for the service functionality.

### FieldStatisticsService Implementation
**Location:** `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS.Services/FieldStatisticsService.cs`

Implemented four new methods:

1. **CalculateApplicationStatistics(double currentSpeed, double toolWidth)** - Calculates and returns an ApplicationStatistics object with:
   - TotalAreaCovered from WorkedAreaSquareMeters
   - CoveragePercentage calculated from ActualAreaCovered / BoundaryAreaSquareMeters * 100 (clamped 0-100)
   - WorkRate from existing GetWorkRatePerHour method
   - ApplicationRateTarget and ActualApplicationRate default to 0.0 (placeholders for future configuration/section control integration)

2. **GetRotatingDisplayData(int screenNumber, double currentSpeed, double toolWidth)** - Returns RotatingDisplayData with appropriate content based on screen number:
   - Screen 1: Populates AppStats using CalculateApplicationStatistics
   - Screen 2: Populates FieldName using GetCurrentFieldName
   - Screen 3: Populates GuidanceLineInfo using GetActiveGuidanceLineInfo and FormatGuidanceLineInfo helper
   - Invalid screen numbers default to screen 1

3. **GetCurrentFieldName()** - Returns current field name:
   - Currently returns "No Field" placeholder
   - TODO: Will integrate with field management service when available

4. **GetActiveGuidanceLineInfo()** - Returns tuple of (GuidanceLineType, heading):
   - Currently returns (GuidanceLineType.ABLine, 0.0) default
   - TODO: Will integrate with IABLineService, ICurveLineService, IContourService when needed

Added two private helper methods:
- **CalculateCoveragePercentage()** - Calculates field coverage percentage with bounds checking
- **FormatGuidanceLineInfo(GuidanceLineType, double)** - Formats guidance line info as "Line: [Type] [Heading]°"

**Rationale:** The implementation follows the spec requirements exactly while providing safe defaults for dependencies that will be added in future integration tasks. The service can function independently and be tested without requiring field or guidance services.

### FieldStatisticsServiceTests
**Location:** `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS.Services.Tests/FieldStatisticsServiceTests.cs`

Created 6 focused unit tests:
1. **CalculateApplicationStatistics_WithWorkedArea_ReturnsPopulatedStats** - Verifies application statistics calculation with worked area and boundary
2. **GetRotatingDisplayData_Screen1_ReturnsAppStats** - Verifies screen 1 returns populated application statistics
3. **GetRotatingDisplayData_Screen2_ReturnsFieldName** - Verifies screen 2 returns field name
4. **GetRotatingDisplayData_Screen3_ReturnsGuidanceLineInfo** - Verifies screen 3 returns guidance line info containing "Line:"
5. **GetCurrentFieldName_NoFieldSet_ReturnsDefault** - Verifies default field name is returned when no field set
6. **GetActiveGuidanceLineInfo_NoActiveLine_ReturnsDefault** - Verifies default guidance line (ABLine, 0.0) is returned

Added helper method CreateBoundary(double areaSquareMeters) to create test boundaries using BoundaryPolygon and BoundaryPoint.

**Rationale:** Tests focus on core functionality and data structure verification without exhaustive edge case testing, following the minimal testing approach specified in tasks.md.

## Database Changes
No database changes required for this task.

## Dependencies
No new external dependencies added.

### Internal Dependencies
- Uses existing AgValoniaGPS.Models types: Boundary, BoundaryPolygon, BoundaryPoint
- Uses new AgValoniaGPS.Models.Display types: ApplicationStatistics, RotatingDisplayData
- Uses AgValoniaGPS.Models.Guidance.GuidanceLineType enum (existing from Wave 2)

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS.Services.Tests/FieldStatisticsServiceTests.cs` - 6 tests for Wave 7 expansion methods
- `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS/AgValoniaGPS.Services.Tests/Display/DisplayModelsTests.cs` - Updated to use correct GuidanceLineType namespace

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete (6 focused tests as specified)
- Integration tests: ⚠️ Deferred (future integration with field and guidance services)
- Edge cases covered: Default values, screen number routing, basic calculations

### Manual Testing Performed
Ran the 6 FieldStatisticsServiceTests:
```
Passed!  - Failed: 0, Passed: 6, Skipped: 0, Total: 6, Duration: 10 ms
```

All tests pass successfully:
- CalculateApplicationStatistics calculates stats correctly with boundary and worked area
- GetRotatingDisplayData routes to correct screen content (1=stats, 2=field name, 3=guidance)
- GetCurrentFieldName returns non-empty default
- GetActiveGuidanceLineInfo returns default ABLine with 0.0 heading

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### API Standards
**File Reference:** `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The FieldStatisticsService follows service-oriented architecture patterns with clear method signatures, comprehensive XML documentation, and appropriate return types. Methods use primitive types and domain models for inputs/outputs, making the service easily testable and mockable.

### Global Coding Style
**File Reference:** `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Code uses consistent C# naming conventions (PascalCase for methods, camelCase for parameters), regions to organize code sections (Wave 7 methods, private helpers), and clear method names that describe functionality. XML documentation is comprehensive with examples and parameter descriptions.

### Global Conventions
**File Reference:** `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The implementation maintains consistent project structure with interface and implementation in Services folder, tests in Services.Tests folder following the established pattern. TODO comments mark future integration points clearly.

### Error Handling
**File Reference:** `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All methods return safe defaults rather than throwing exceptions. CalculateCoveragePercentage includes bounds checking (0-100 clamp), GetRotatingDisplayData handles invalid screen numbers by defaulting to screen 1, and division operations check for zero denominators.

### Test Writing Standards
**File Reference:** `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Tests follow AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern with clear test names describing scenarios and expected outcomes. Focused on core user flows (screen routing, calculation correctness) with minimal edge case testing per standard guidance. Test count limited to 6 focused tests as specified.

## Integration Points

### Internal Dependencies
- **AgValoniaGPS.Models.Boundary**: Used to set BoundaryAreaSquareMeters via UpdateBoundaryArea method
- **AgValoniaGPS.Models.Display**: Returns ApplicationStatistics and RotatingDisplayData models
- **AgValoniaGPS.Models.Guidance.GuidanceLineType**: Used in GetActiveGuidanceLineInfo return tuple

### Future Integration (TODO markers in code)
- **Field Management Service**: GetCurrentFieldName will retrieve from IFieldService when available
- **Guidance Line Services**: GetActiveGuidanceLineInfo will query IABLineService, ICurveLineService, IContourService for active line

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Limitations
1. **Placeholder Return Values**
   - Description: GetCurrentFieldName returns "No Field", GetActiveGuidanceLineInfo returns (ABLine, 0.0)
   - Reason: Field management and guidance line services not yet integrated
   - Future Consideration: Integration will be addressed in Task Group 5 (Service Registration & Integration)

2. **Static Application Rates**
   - Description: ApplicationRateTarget and ActualApplicationRate default to 0.0
   - Reason: Configuration system and section control data integration not yet implemented
   - Future Consideration: Will be populated from configuration and ISectionControlService when integrated

3. **Preserved FormatArea/FormatDistance**
   - Description: FormatArea and FormatDistance methods remain in FieldStatisticsService (spec called for removal to DisplayFormatterService)
   - Reason: MainViewModel depends on these methods; removal would break existing UI functionality
   - Deviation: Kept methods to maintain backward compatibility; DisplayFormatterService will provide enhanced formatting

## Performance Considerations
All methods perform simple calculations or return pre-calculated values. CalculateApplicationStatistics calls CalculateOverlap which is O(1), and CalculateCoveragePercentage is O(1). GetRotatingDisplayData performs a simple switch statement - O(1) complexity. No performance concerns identified.

## Security Considerations
No security-sensitive operations performed. All calculations use trusted internal data (WorkedAreaSquareMeters, BoundaryAreaSquareMeters). No external input validation required as methods accept primitive types.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- Task Group 5 (Integration & DI) depends on this implementation for registering IFieldStatisticsService in dependency injection container
- Future UI implementation will consume RotatingDisplayData for display rotation logic

## Notes
- Successfully resolved GuidanceLineType namespace collision by removing duplicate enum from Display namespace and using existing Models.Guidance.GuidanceLineType
- Test helper method CreateBoundary uses BoundaryPolygon (not BoundaryList as initially attempted) matching the actual domain model structure
- Implemented interface-first approach improving service contract clarity and enabling future mocking/testing
- All 6 tests pass on first full execution after resolving namespace and boundary model issues
