### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check
**Status:** PASS

**Unnecessary New Components:**
- DisplayFormatterService: NEW COMPONENT - JUSTIFIED (legacy formatting embedded in WinForms UI, must be extracted)
- ApplicationStatistics model: NEW MODEL - JUSTIFIED (doesn't exist in legacy, needed for structured data)
- GpsQualityDisplay model: NEW MODEL - JUSTIFIED (doesn't exist in legacy, needed for color mapping)
- RotatingDisplayData model: NEW MODEL - JUSTIFIED (doesn't exist in legacy, needed for rotating display)
- GuidanceLineType enum: NEW ENUM - JUSTIFIED (simple enum for display purposes)

**Duplicated Logic:**
- NONE IDENTIFIED
- Spec correctly identifies reusing UnitSystem enum instead of creating new one
- Spec correctly identifies reusing Position model instead of duplicating properties
- Spec correctly identifies expanding existing FieldStatisticsService instead of creating new one

**Missing Reuse Opportunities:**
- NONE IDENTIFIED
- UnitSystem enum properly reused (spec.md line 79)
- UnitSystemExtensions conversion methods noted (spec.md lines 81-84)
- Position model properly referenced (spec.md lines 87-89)
- Service registration pattern properly followed (spec.md lines 91-93)
- Existing Wave services properly integrated (spec.md lines 95-101)

**Justification for New Code:**
- DisplayFormatterService: Justified - spec.md lines 104-108 explain legacy code embedded in UI
- Display models: Justified - spec.md lines 110-115 explain no existing structures
- FieldStatisticsService expansion: Justified - spec.md lines 117-119 explain partial existence

## Critical Issues
**None identified**

## Minor Issues
**None identified**

## Over-Engineering Concerns
**None identified**

All services and models are appropriately scoped to the requirements. No excessive abstraction or unnecessary complexity detected. The spec follows the principle of reusing existing code where possible and creating new components only when justified.

## Standards Compliance Check

### NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md Compliance:
- Display/ directory name: VERIFIED - Listed in "Approved Directory Names for Future Use" (NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md line 38)
- No namespace collision: VERIFIED - "Display" is not a reserved class name
- Service naming: VERIFIED - DisplayFormatterService and FieldStatisticsService follow {Functionality}Service pattern
- Interface naming: VERIFIED - IDisplayFormatterService and IFieldStatisticsService follow I{ServiceName} pattern
- Namespace pattern: VERIFIED - AgValoniaGPS.Services.Display follows AgValoniaGPS.Services.{FunctionalArea}
- Models directory: VERIFIED - AgValoniaGPS.Models/Display/ follows pattern

### test-writing.md Compliance:
- Minimal test approach: VERIFIED - 2-8 tests per task group, focused on core flows
- Test behavior not implementation: VERIFIED - Tests focus on format outputs, not internal logic
- Fast execution: VERIFIED - <1ms performance requirement aligns with fast test philosophy
- Mock external dependencies: VERIFIED - No external dependencies in formatters (stateless)
- Test core user flows: VERIFIED - Tests focus on primary formatting scenarios, defer edge cases to testing-engineer

### Tech Stack Compliance:
- Test framework: xUnit and NUnit mentioned in spec (consistent with existing AgValoniaGPS tests)
- .NET 8: Implicit (consistent with AgValoniaGPS project)
- Dependency Injection: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection (consistent with existing pattern)

### Other Standards (Global):
- Coding style: Not assessed in spec verification (implementation concern)
- Error handling: VERIFIED - Spec specifies "never throw exceptions" and "return safe defaults" (spec.md line 31, lines 534-551)
- Validation: VERIFIED - Spec specifies handling NaN, Infinity, negative values gracefully

## Alignment with User Q&A

All user answers are faithfully reflected in the specification:

1. Unit System Support: Metric and Imperial only, no mixed units - ALIGNED
2. Speed Precision: Dynamic precision maintained - ALIGNED
3. GPS Quality Color Coding: Existing mappings used - ALIGNED
4. Heading Display Formats: Degrees only with ° symbol - ALIGNED
5. Time Formatting: Decimal hours format - ALIGNED
6. Localization & Culture: InvariantCulture throughout - ALIGNED
7. Formatter Service Organization: Unified DisplayFormatterService - ALIGNED
8. Performance Requirement: Straightforward calculation, no caching - ALIGNED
9. Explicit Exclusions: UI wiring excluded from scope - ALIGNED

## Visual Asset Integration

All 6 visual files are:
- Present in planning/visuals folder
- Referenced in requirements.md with detailed analysis
- Design elements extracted and specified in spec.md
- Format requirements match visual examples
- Rotating display pattern (3 screens) properly documented
- Tasks align with visual requirements

Visual coverage is COMPREHENSIVE.

## Test Writing Limits Compliance

The specification and tasks follow the limited testing approach correctly:
- Implementation tasks specify 2-8 tests per group
- Testing-engineer limited to maximum 12 additional tests
- Total expected: 26-44 tests (within reasonable range for LOW complexity)
- Test verification limited to newly written tests only
- No requirements for comprehensive or exhaustive testing
- Edge cases deferred to testing-engineer phase

This aligns with the focused, minimal testing philosophy.

## Recommendations

1. **Minor Clarification - GpsFixType Enum:**
   - Task 1.7 instructs to check if GpsFixType exists in Communication/ folder
   - Spec shows GpsFixType enum values (spec.md lines 220-227) but location is conditional
   - RECOMMENDATION: During implementation, if GpsFixType doesn't exist in Communication/, create it in Display/ as specified
   - This is properly handled in tasks, just noting for implementer awareness

2. **Performance Benchmarking:**
   - Task 5.6 includes performance benchmark tests
   - RECOMMENDATION: Document actual performance results in Wave 7 completion summary
   - This will provide baseline for future optimization if needed

3. **Integration Dependencies:**
   - FieldStatisticsService expansion may need dependencies on other services (Task 4.7 notes this)
   - RECOMMENDATION: During implementation, if circular dependencies are detected, refactor to event-based communication pattern
   - DI verification in Task 5.5 will catch this early

4. **Documentation Enhancement:**
   - Spec is comprehensive but could benefit from example usage section
   - RECOMMENDATION: After implementation, consider adding "Quick Start" or "Usage Examples" section to spec
   - Not critical for implementation, just for long-term maintainability

5. **Edge Case Consistency:**
   - Spec specifies returning safe defaults for NaN/Infinity but formats vary slightly
   - RECOMMENDATION: Create a private helper method in DisplayFormatterService for consistent safe default generation
   - Example: `private string GetSafeDefault(string unit) => $"0.0{unit}"`
   - This would ensure consistency across all formatters

## Conclusion

**Overall Assessment: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

The Wave 7 specification and tasks list are well-aligned with user requirements, properly leverage existing code, follow naming conventions, comply with testing philosophy, and integrate visual design requirements comprehensively.

**Strengths:**
- Accurate capture of all user answers from requirements discussion
- Comprehensive visual asset integration with detailed analysis
- Proper reusability of existing components (UnitSystem, Position, service patterns)
- Compliant test writing limits (26-44 focused tests, not exhaustive)
- Clear scope boundaries (UI implementation explicitly excluded)
- Well-organized task breakdown with clear dependencies
- No namespace collisions or over-engineering detected
- Performance requirements clearly specified (<1ms)
- Culture-invariant formatting properly emphasized

**Verification Score:**
- Requirements Accuracy: 10/10
- Visual Integration: 10/10
- Reusability: 10/10
- Test Writing Limits: 10/10
- Standards Compliance: 10/10
- Task Specificity: 10/10
- Scope Appropriateness: 10/10

**VERDICT: PASS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS**

The specification is approved for implementation. The recommendations listed above are minor enhancements that can be addressed during or after implementation and do not block progress.

Implementation teams (api-engineer and testing-engineer) can proceed with confidence that the specification accurately reflects requirements and follows all established patterns and conventions.
