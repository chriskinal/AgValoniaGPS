### Check 5: Core Specification Issues
**Status:** PASSED

**Goal Alignment:**
Spec goal (lines 3-4) directly addresses user need for "centralized state management infrastructure with configuration services, session management with crash recovery, multi-profile support, validation services, and undo/redo capabilities."

**User Stories:**
All 7 user stories (lines 6-13) trace back to requirements:
1. Settings persistence - From Q1, Q5
2. Multiple tractors - From Q9, Follow-up 4
3. User profiles - From Q9, Follow-up 4
4. Crash recovery - From Q3
5. Undo changes - From Q6
6. Validation - From Q8, Follow-up 3
7. Setup wizard - From Q7

**Core Requirements:**
All items in spec.md lines 17-28 map to user answers:
- Centralized Configuration Service - Q2
- Dual-format persistence - Q1
- Dual-write strategy - Follow-up 5
- Multi-vehicle/user profiles - Q9, Follow-up 4
- Session management - Q3
- Validation Service - Q8
- Undo/Redo - Q6
- Lifecycle management - Q7
- Mediator pattern - Q4
- Optional migration tool - Follow-up 5

**Out of Scope:**
Matches requirements out-of-scope (spec.md lines 1371-1385)

**Reusability Notes:**
Spec properly references (lines 59-87):
- ServiceCollectionExtensions registration pattern
- VehicleConfiguration model extension
- Event-driven architecture from existing services
- Integration points with Waves 1-7

### Check 6: Task List Issues
**Status:** PASSED

**Test Writing Limits:**
- Task Group 1: "Write 2-8 focused tests" (line 33) - COMPLIANT
- Task Group 2: "Write 2-8 focused tests" (line 112) - COMPLIANT
- Task Group 3: "Write 2-8 focused tests" (line 181) - COMPLIANT
- Task Group 4: "Write 2-8 focused tests" (line 254) - COMPLIANT
- Task Group 5: "Write 2-8 focused tests" (line 355) - COMPLIANT
- Task Group 6: "Write 2-8 focused tests" (line 426) - COMPLIANT
- Task Group 7: "Write 2-8 focused tests" (line 498) - COMPLIANT
- Task Group 8: "Write 2-8 focused tests" (line 563) - COMPLIANT
- Task Group 9: "Write 2-8 focused tests" (line 639) - COMPLIANT
- Task Group 10: "Write up to 10 additional strategic tests maximum" (line 739) - COMPLIANT

**Expected Total Tests:** 16-24 from Groups 1-9 + max 10 from Group 10 = 26-34 total tests
**Documented in tasks.md line 786:** "approximately 26-34 tests maximum" - CORRECT

**Test Verification Subtasks:**
- All groups run ONLY newly written tests (lines 88-91, 159-161, 228-231, 330-333, 400-403, 471-476, 539-542, 614-617, 704-707)
- No tasks call for running entire test suite during development - COMPLIANT
- Testing-engineer adds maximum 10 tests (line 739) - COMPLIANT

**Reusability References:**
- Task 3.3: References VehicleConfiguration model (spec.md line 67-71) - CORRECT
- Task 9.2: References ServiceCollectionExtensions pattern (line 643-651) - CORRECT
- Task 9.6-9.12: Reference integration with Waves 1-7 (lines 664-699) - CORRECT

**Task Specificity:**
All tasks reference specific features/components:
- Task 1.2-1.13: Each creates specific settings model
- Task 3.2-3.11: Each implements specific Configuration Service component
- Task 4.4-4.15: Each implements specific validator
- All tasks trace back to requirements - VERIFIED

**Visual References:**
- Task 1 (Settings Models): Visual settings categories directly mapped (line 44)
- Task 3.5 (JSON Provider): References spec.md JSON format from visual (line 203)
- Task 3.6 (XML Provider): References spec.md XML format from visual (line 208)
- Task 3.7 (Converter): References conversion notes from visual analysis (line 214)

**Task Count:**
- Task Group 1: 15 subtasks (models creation) - REASONABLE (11 settings models + event args + tests)
- Task Group 2: 12 subtasks (session/profile models) - REASONABLE
- Task Group 3: 11 subtasks (Configuration Service) - REASONABLE
- Task Group 4: 16 subtasks (Validation Service) - REASONABLE (11 validators + cross-validator + tests)
- Task Group 5: 10 subtasks (Profile Management) - REASONABLE
- Task Group 6: 11 subtasks (Session Management) - REASONABLE
- Task Group 7: 11 subtasks (State Mediator) - REASONABLE
- Task Group 8: 11 subtasks (Undo/Redo) - REASONABLE
- Task Group 9: 14 subtasks (Integration) - REASONABLE
- Task Group 10: 10 subtasks (Testing) - REASONABLE

All task groups stay within 3-16 range (acceptable for complex features).

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check
**Status:** PASSED

**Unnecessary New Components:**
None detected. All new components are required because:
- Configuration Service: No centralized settings management exists
- Session Management: No crash recovery exists in legacy system
- Validation Service: Validation embedded in legacy UI, needs extraction
- StateMediator: No coordination layer exists
- Undo/Redo: No undo capability exists in legacy system
- Profile Management: Legacy only supports single vehicle per installation

**Duplicated Logic:**
None detected. Spec correctly notes (lines 87-128) that new components are required because legacy settings are scattered across WinForms UI.

**Missing Reuse Opportunities:**
None. Requirements.md correctly notes (line 46-49): "No specific similar features were identified for reference, as this is foundational infrastructure."

However, spec properly identifies reuse opportunities:
- ServiceCollectionExtensions registration pattern (spec.md line 62-66)
- VehicleConfiguration model extension (spec.md line 67-71)
- Event-driven architecture pattern (spec.md line 73-77)

**Justification for New Code:**
Each new service section in spec.md (lines 87-128) includes "Cannot reuse existing code because..." explanation:
- Configuration Service: Legacy settings scattered across WinForms UI
- Session Management: No crash recovery exists
- Validation Service: Validation embedded in legacy UI
- StateMediator: No coordination layer exists
- Undo/Redo: No undo capability exists
- Profile Management: Legacy only supports single vehicle

All justifications are valid.

## Critical Issues
**Status:** NONE FOUND

No critical issues that must be fixed before implementation.

---

## Minor Issues
**Status:** 3 MINOR RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Atomic Dual-Write Transaction Pattern
**Location:** spec.md line 33, tasks.md line 218

**Issue:** Spec mentions "atomic dual-write" but doesn't specify exact pattern for ensuring atomicity.

**Recommendation:** Add explicit guidance in spec.md Technical Approach section:
```
Atomic Dual-Write Pattern:
1. Write JSON to temp file
2. Write XML to temp file
3. If both succeed, rename temp files to final names (atomic operation)
4. If either fails, delete both temp files and rollback
```

**Impact:** Low - Implementation will likely handle this, but explicit guidance prevents inconsistency.

### 2. XML Property Name Mapping Strategy
**Location:** spec.md lines 981-988, tasks.md line 213

**Issue:** Conversion notes mention property name differences (e.g., "MaxSteerDeg" vs "MaxSteerAngle") but don't provide complete mapping table.

**Recommendation:** Add complete XML-to-JSON property mapping table in spec.md or create separate mapping document. Example differences noted but not exhaustive:
- MaxSteerDeg → MaxSteerAngle
- CPD → CountsPerDegree
- ToolWidth (integer code) → ToolWidth (decimal meters)
- LowSpeedCutoff (0.5 stored) → (1.0 actual value)

**Impact:** Low - Developers will discover mappings from visual, but explicit table would prevent errors.

### 3. Setup Wizard UI-Agnostic Implementation
**Location:** spec.md lines 329-348, tasks.md lines 652-663

**Issue:** Spec states "No UI implementation in this Wave" (line 350) but SetupWizardService interface includes methods like GetWizardSteps() that imply UI interaction.

**Recommendation:** Clarify that ISetupWizardService provides data structures for UI consumption but doesn't render UI. Add note:
```
Note: ISetupWizardService is UI-agnostic. It provides wizard step data structures
(step descriptions, default values, validation rules) that future UI layers will render.
No Avalonia UI implementation in Wave 8.
```

**Impact:** Very Low - Likely understood, but explicit clarification prevents confusion.

---

## Over-Engineering Concerns
**Status:** NONE FOUND

The specification is appropriately scoped for the complexity of the requirements:

**Justified Complexity:**
1. **11 Settings Models:** Required to represent 50+ settings from visual in hierarchical structure
2. **Dual-Format Persistence:** User explicitly requested XML compatibility + JSON modernization
3. **Multi-Profile Support:** User explicitly required multi-vehicle and multi-user support
4. **Crash Recovery:** User explicitly requested to solve current system problem
5. **Validation Service:** User explicitly requested separate validation service
6. **Mediator Pattern:** User explicitly preferred mediator over tight coupling
7. **Undo/Redo:** User explicitly requested for user-entered data

**No Unnecessary Features:**
All features trace back to explicit user requirements.

**Test Count Appropriate:**
26-34 total tests for 6 major services + 11 settings models + dual-format I/O + validation engine is reasonable, not excessive.
