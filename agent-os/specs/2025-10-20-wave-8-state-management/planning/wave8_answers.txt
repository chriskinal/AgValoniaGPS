Wave 8: State Management - User Answers Analysis
=================================================

INITIAL ANSWERS RECEIVED:
-------------------------

1. Settings Persistence Strategy:
   - Maintain XML for compatibility
   - Create JSON equivalents as path to phasing out XML
   - Two-way sync for this first version

2. Configuration Service Pattern:
   - Centralized service is ideal
   - One source of truth for all settings
   - No settings stored in individual services

3. Session Management Scope:
   - Crash recovery is excellent
   - Solves a current system problem

4. State Coordination Between Services:
   - Mediator pattern preferred
   - Services shouldn't get bogged down by central service

5. Settings Migration & Defaults:
   - Two-way for this first version

6. Undo/Redo Scope:
   - User entered data has undo/redo
   - Right scope confirmed

7. Application Lifecycle Management:
   - Both wizard and defaults
   - Walk users through setup with defaults

8. Settings Validation & Constraints:
   - A validation service

9. Multi-User or Multi-Vehicle Support:
   - Multi-vehicle support is a must
   - Users take tablet from tractor to tractor
   - User profile support would be good

Description: Comprehensive view of legacy AgOpenGPS settings structure from Deere 5055e.xml

Key Observations:
- Settings organized in a flat structure with many categories:
  * Culture and language settings
  * Remote work features
  * Vehicle dimensions (wheelbase, track, antenna positions)
  * Steering configuration (PWM values, max steer degrees)
  * Tool configuration (width, offsets, hitches)
  * GPS and RTK settings (heading, IMU fusion)
  * Section control settings
  * Work switches and manual controls

- Data types include:
  * Booleans (True/False flags)
  * Integers (counts, dimensions in cm)
  * Decimals (precise measurements, angular values)
  * Strings (culture codes like "en")

- Settings scope across multiple functional areas:
  * GPS/Navigation (HDOP, Hz, heading)
  * Vehicle/Physical (dimensions, steering limits)
  * Guidance (look ahead, acquire factor)
  * Section Control (number of sections, fast sections flag)
  * Hardware (PWM ranges, IMU fusion weights)

- File naming pattern: [VehicleName].xml (e.g., "Deere 5055e.xml")
  * Suggests vehicle-specific settings files
  * Aligns with multi-vehicle requirement

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS NEEDED:
---------------------------

Yes - Need clarification on:
1. Settings organization structure (categories/hierarchy)
2. Validation rules and constraints (especially for interdependent settings)
3. Service directory naming (per NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md)
4. Vehicle/User profile switching UX
5. XML-to-JSON migration timeline and triggers
