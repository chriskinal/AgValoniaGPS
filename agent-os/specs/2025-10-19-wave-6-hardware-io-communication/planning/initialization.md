# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
Wave 6 focuses on completing the hardware communication layer for AgValoniaGPS. This includes PGN (Parameter Group Number) message handling for communication with AgOpenGPS hardware modules (AutoSteer, Machine, IMU), module connection monitoring, and bi-directional communication protocols.

## Context
- This is part of an 8-wave business logic extraction plan
- Waves 1-5 have been completed (Position, Guidance, Steering, Section Control, Field Operations)
- Some hardware communication already exists: UdpCommunicationService, NmeaParserService
- Wave 6 will enhance and complete the hardware I/O layer

## Key Areas
1. PGN message creation and parsing
2. Module connection monitoring and handshake logic
3. Hardware orchestration and timeout detection
4. Serial and UDP communication services
5. Integration with existing services from Waves 1-5
