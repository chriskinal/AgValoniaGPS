# Task 4: Transport Abstraction Layer

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #4 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-19-wave-6-hardware-io-communication/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implement the Transport Abstraction Layer to enable pluggable transport types (UDP, Bluetooth, CAN, Radio) with per-module transport selection, lifecycle management, message routing, and event forwarding. This layer sits between the Module Coordinator and specific transport implementations, allowing the system to route messages to the correct transport based on module type (e.g., AutoSteer via Bluetooth, Machine via UDP, IMU via CAN).

## Implementation Summary
The Transport Abstraction Layer was implemented as a central service that manages transport instances for multiple hardware modules. The design uses a factory pattern to create transport instances, allowing for easy testing with mock transports and production use with real transport implementations. The service maintains a dictionary mapping each module type to its active transport, routes send operations to the correct transport, and forwards data/connection events from individual transports back to higher-level services with module identification.

The implementation emphasizes thread safety through lock-based dictionary access, clean lifecycle management with async start/stop methods, and proper event subscription/unsubscription to prevent memory leaks. All acceptance criteria were met with 6 comprehensive tests covering transport selection, lifecycle, message routing, and event forwarding.

## Key Implementation Details

### ITransport Base Interface
**Location:** `AgValoniaGPS.Services/Communication/Transports/ITransport.cs`

The ITransport interface provides a common abstraction for all transport types. It defines:
- **Properties**: `TransportType Type` (identifies the transport), `bool IsConnected` (connection status)
- **Methods**: `Task StartAsync()` (initialize and connect), `Task StopAsync()` (cleanup and disconnect), `void Send(byte[] data)` (transmit PGN message)
- **Events**: `EventHandler<byte[]> DataReceived` (incoming data), `EventHandler<bool> ConnectionChanged` (connection state changes)

**Rationale:** This interface enables the strategy pattern, allowing different transport implementations (UDP, Bluetooth, CAN, Radio) to be swapped without changing higher-level code. The async lifecycle methods support non-blocking initialization, critical for network and hardware operations.

### ITransportAbstractionService Interface
**Location:** `AgValoniaGPS.Services/Communication/ITransportAbstractionService.cs`

The service interface defines the public API for the abstraction layer:
- **Transport Management**: `StartTransportAsync()`, `StopTransportAsync()`, `SendMessage()`
- **Configuration**: `GetActiveTransport()`, `SetPreferredTransport()`
- **Events**: `DataReceived`, `TransportStateChanged`

**Rationale:** This interface separates the abstraction layer's public contract from its implementation, enabling dependency injection and unit testing with mocks.

### TransportAbstractionService Implementation
**Location:** `AgValoniaGPS.Services/Communication/TransportAbstractionService.cs`

The core implementation manages:
1. **Transport Registration**: Factory pattern via `RegisterTransportFactory()` allows runtime registration of transport creators
2. **Per-Module Transport Storage**: `Dictionary<ModuleType, ITransport>` maps each module to its active transport
3. **Lifecycle Management**: `StartTransportAsync()` creates transport via factory, subscribes to events, starts it, and stores in dictionary; `StopTransportAsync()` reverses this process
4. **Message Routing**: `SendMessage()` looks up the module's transport and calls its `Send()` method
5. **Event Forwarding**: Subscribes to each transport's `DataReceived` and `ConnectionChanged` events, then republishes them with module identification via `TransportDataReceivedEventArgs` and `TransportStateChangedEventArgs`
6. **Thread Safety**: All dictionary operations are protected by `lock (_lockObject)`

**Rationale:** The factory pattern enables testability (inject mock factories) and extensibility (new transports registered without code changes). The dictionary approach provides O(1) lookup for routing messages. Event forwarding centralizes all transport events, allowing higher-level services to subscribe once instead of tracking multiple transport instances.

### Transport Lifecycle Management
**Location:** `AgValoniaGPS.Services/Communication/TransportAbstractionService.cs` (methods: `StartTransportAsync`, `StopTransportAsync`)

Lifecycle management follows this sequence:

**Starting:**
1. Check module doesn't already have active transport (throws if duplicate)
2. Verify transport factory is registered (throws if missing)
3. Create transport instance via factory
4. Subscribe to transport events (`DataReceived`, `ConnectionChanged`)
5. Call `transport.StartAsync()`
6. Store in `_activeTransports` dictionary
7. Raise `TransportStateChanged` event

**Stopping:**
1. Retrieve transport from dictionary (exits silently if not found)
2. Remove from dictionary
3. Unsubscribe from transport events
4. Call `transport.StopAsync()`
5. Raise `TransportStateChanged` event

**Rationale:** Event subscription before starting prevents race conditions where data arrives before the subscription is registered. Unsubscription during stop prevents memory leaks. Silent exit for stop-when-not-running allows idempotent cleanup.

### Event Forwarding Implementation
**Location:** `AgValoniaGPS.Services/Communication/TransportAbstractionService.cs` (methods: `OnTransportDataReceived`, `OnTransportConnectionChanged`)

Event forwarding involves:
1. **Transport Event Handlers**: `OnTransportDataReceived()` and `OnTransportConnectionChanged()` receive events from individual transports
2. **Module Identification**: `GetModuleForTransport()` searches the dictionary to identify which module the transport belongs to
3. **Event Publishing**: Constructs `TransportDataReceivedEventArgs` or `TransportStateChangedEventArgs` with module information and raises service-level events

**Rationale:** Module identification is crucial because multiple modules use different transports simultaneously. Higher-level services need to know which module sent data. The reverse lookup via `GetModuleForTransport()` maintains loose coupling (transports don't need to know their module).

### Thread Safety
**Location:** Throughout `TransportAbstractionService.cs`

Thread safety is achieved through:
- **Dictionary Protection**: All accesses to `_activeTransports`, `_preferredTransports`, and `_transportFactories` are wrapped in `lock (_lockObject)`
- **Event Publishing**: C# events are inherently thread-safe for invocation
- **Async Method Design**: `StartTransportAsync` and `StopTransportAsync` perform transport operations outside the lock to prevent deadlocks

**Rationale:** The service will be accessed concurrently from UI thread (configuration changes) and guidance loop thread (sending messages). Lock-based synchronization provides straightforward protection. Minimizing lock scope (only for dictionary access) prevents blocking async operations.

## Database Changes
None - this is a pure service layer implementation.

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Added
None - uses only existing AgValoniaGPS framework dependencies (.NET 8, existing model classes).

### Configuration Changes
None - transport factories are registered programmatically, either in DI setup or test fixtures.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `AgValoniaGPS.Services.Tests/Communication/TransportAbstractionServiceTests.cs` - Created with 6 comprehensive tests

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete (6 tests covering all acceptance criteria)
- Integration tests: N/A (deferred to Task Group 11)
- Edge cases covered:
  - Per-module transport selection (Test 1)
  - Transport lifecycle start/stop (Test 2)
  - Message routing to correct transport (Test 3)
  - DataReceived event forwarding with module identification (Test 4)
  - TransportStateChanged event publishing (Test 5)
  - GetActiveTransport correctness and exception handling (Test 6)

### Manual Testing Performed
All 6 automated tests executed and passed:
```
Test Run Successful.
Total tests: 6
     Passed: 6
 Total time: 1.7928 Seconds
```

Test execution verified:
- Different modules can use different transports simultaneously (AutoSteer→BT, Machine→UDP, IMU→CAN)
- Transport start increments call counter, stop increments call counter
- Messages route to correct transport based on module
- Data received events include correct module identification
- Connection state change events propagate correctly
- Invalid operations throw appropriate exceptions (getting transport for non-started module)

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Global Coding Style (`agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`)
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Used meaningful names (`TransportAbstractionService`, `OnTransportDataReceived`), kept methods focused on single tasks, maintained consistent indentation, removed no dead code (all code is new), followed DRY principle by centralizing event forwarding logic.

**Deviations:** None

### API Standards (`agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`)
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
While this is a service layer (not REST API), the interface design follows API principles: consistent naming (`StartTransportAsync`, `StopTransportAsync`), appropriate return types (Task for async, void for synchronous send), clear parameter naming, and predictable behavior.

**Deviations:** Not applicable - this is internal service layer, not external API.

### Naming Conventions (`NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`)
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Followed conventions exactly: created `Communication/` functional area directory (not `Module/` or `Transport/` to avoid namespace collision), used `Service` suffix for service class, created `Transports/` subdirectory per spec, used interface naming with `I` prefix.

**Deviations:** None

### Error Handling (`agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`)
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Throws `InvalidOperationException` for logical errors (starting transport when already started, sending to non-existent transport), throws `ArgumentException` for invalid arguments (transport type not registered), validates null arguments (`data` parameter). Event handlers use null-conditional operator (`?.`) to safely handle no subscribers.

**Deviations:** None

### Threading/Concurrency (`agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md` - DRY, focused functions)
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Used simple lock-based synchronization with single lock object, minimized lock scope to dictionary access only, performed async operations outside locks to prevent deadlocks, ensured event subscription/unsubscription is thread-safe.

**Deviations:** None

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified.

### Limitations
1. **Transport Factory Registration Required**
   - Description: Transports must be registered via `RegisterTransportFactory()` before use
   - Reason: Factory pattern enables testability and flexibility
   - Future Consideration: Could auto-register known transports in constructor if DI provides them, but current design is more explicit and testable

2. **No Automatic Transport Switching**
   - Description: `SetPreferredTransport()` only affects next `StartTransportAsync()` call, doesn't switch running transports
   - Reason: Switching live transports would disrupt in-flight messages and requires careful state management
   - Future Consideration: Could implement hot-swapping with message queuing and state transfer in future enhancement

## Performance Considerations
- **Message Routing**: O(1) dictionary lookup for module-to-transport mapping
- **Event Forwarding**: Single reverse lookup to identify module from transport, acceptable overhead for event-driven architecture
- **Lock Contention**: Lock scope minimized to dictionary access only; async transport operations occur outside lock
- **Memory**: One transport instance per module (max 3 transports for AutoSteer/Machine/IMU), minimal overhead

Performance benchmarks deferred to Task Group 11 (full integration tests).

## Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: Validates all method parameters (null checks, existence checks)
- **Exception Safety**: Throws clear exceptions for misuse (duplicate start, missing factory, non-existent module)
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper unsubscription prevents memory leaks
- **Thread Safety**: Lock-based synchronization prevents race conditions

No security vulnerabilities identified.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
This implementation is a dependency for:
- **Task Group 5**: UDP Transport Implementation (implements ITransport)
- **Task Group 6**: Module Coordinator Service (uses ITransportAbstractionService)
- **Task Group 7**: Module Communication Services (uses ITransportAbstractionService)
- **Task Group 8**: Alternative Transport Implementations (implements ITransport)

## Notes
- The factory pattern for transport creation enables excellent testability - all tests use `MockTransport` instances
- Event forwarding with module identification is crucial for the coordinator layer to know which module sent data
- Thread safety design allows concurrent message sending from guidance loop while UI changes transport configuration
- The `TryGetPreferredTransport()` helper method (public) could be useful for UI to display preferred transport without requiring active transport
- Implementation follows existing service patterns from Waves 1-5 (e.g., PositionUpdateService's lock-based thread safety)
