### Check 5: Core Specification Issues

**Goal Alignment:**
✅ Goal (spec.md lines 3-4) directly addresses extracting steering algorithms with 100Hz performance, matching user's requirement for MCU 100Hz loop

**User Stories:**
✅ Story 1: Algorithm selection via UI - Matches Q1 answer (separate algorithms, user selects)

✅ Story 4: Tuning parameters in UI - Matches Q4 answer (expose all parameters)
✅ Story 5: Real-time algorithm switching - Matches Q7 answer (real-time switching allowed)

**Core Requirements:**
✅ Lines 16-24: All functional requirements map to user answers
✅ Lines 27-31: Non-functional requirements include 100Hz capability (Q3), thread safety, numerical stability
✅ No additional features beyond user requests

**Out of Scope:**
✅ Line 289: Correctly states "Nothing explicitly excluded" per Q9 answer

**Reusability Notes:**
✅ Lines 42-70: Comprehensive reusability section documenting:

✅ Task Group 2: Traces to Q1 (Stanley as separate algorithm)
✅ Task Group 3: Traces to Q1 (Pure Pursuit as separate algorithm)
✅ Task Group 4: Traces to Q6 (PGN via UDP), Q7 (real-time switching), Q2 (flat directory)
✅ Task Group 5: Traces to Q8 (edge case testing), Q3 (100Hz performance)

**Scope:**

✅ Task Group 5: 6 subtasks (within 3-10 range)
✅ Total: 30 subtasks across 5 task groups (reasonable for 12-16 hour estimate)

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check

**Unnecessary New Components:**
✅ No unnecessary components - All four new services justified:
  - StanleySteeringService: Existing GuidanceService mixes concerns (spec.md lines 74-75)
  - PurePursuitService: Requires goal point calculation not in existing services (spec.md lines 77-79)
  - LookAheadDistanceService: Existing service missing curvature/vehicle type adaptation (spec.md lines 81-86)
  - SteeringCoordinatorService: No existing coordinator for algorithm switching (spec.md lines 88-89)

**Duplicated Logic:**
✅ No duplication - Spec explicitly documents extraction and refactoring:
  - Task 1.3: Extract from existing GuidanceService (reuse existing algorithm)
  - Task 2.3: Extract and refactor from GuidanceService (reuse proven logic)
  - Task 3.3: Extract from GuidanceService (reuse existing implementation)
  - Lines 386-391: Documents what to deprecate after migration

**Missing Reuse Opportunities:**
✅ No missed opportunities - Comprehensive reusability section:
  - Wave 1 services: PositionUpdateService, VehicleKinematicsService, Position models
  - Wave 2 services: ABLineService, CurveLineService, ContourService, GuidanceLineResult
  - Infrastructure: UdpCommunicationService, VehicleConfiguration, PgnMessage, PgnNumbers
  - Legacy reference code paths provided for extraction
  - Existing partial implementation noted

**Justification for New Code:**
✅ Clear justification provided (spec.md lines 72-90):
  - Separation of concerns (single responsibility per service)
  - Algorithm switching requires separate implementations
  - Missing features in existing services (curvature adaptation, vehicle type consideration)
  - Need for coordinator pattern to manage multiple algorithms

**Architecture Alignment:**
✅ Follows user's architectural preferences:
  - Q2: Flat directory structure in Guidance/ (no Steering/ subdirectory)
  - Service-based architecture consistent with Wave 1 & Wave 2
  - Dependency injection pattern
  - Interface-based design for testability
  - ReactiveUI for real-time data flow

## Critical Issues
None identified.

## Minor Issues
None identified.

## Over-Engineering Concerns
None identified. All new components are justified and necessary for:
1. Separation of concerns (Stanley vs Pure Pursuit vs Look-Ahead)
2. Real-time algorithm switching (requires separate service instances)
3. Missing functionality (curvature adaptation, vehicle type scaling)
4. Coordinator pattern (managing multiple algorithms and PGN output)

## User Standards Compliance

### Testing Standards Compliance
✅ Follows `agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`:
- "Write Minimal Tests During Development": ✅ Each task group writes 4-7 tests only (lines 32-38, 76-82, 126-132, 179-184)
- "Test Only Core User Flows": ✅ Tests focus on core algorithms and formulas
- "Defer Edge Case Testing": ✅ Edge cases deferred to Task Group 5 (testing-engineer)
- "Fast Execution": ✅ Performance requirement: all tests complete in <5 seconds (line 378)

### Tech Stack Compliance
Note: `agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md` is a template file with no project-specific values filled in.

✅ Spec aligns with CLAUDE.md project overview:
- .NET 8.0 (modern version of .NET Framework 4.8 mentioned in CLAUDE.md)
- Avalonia UI 11.3.6 (cross-platform UI framework)
- ReactiveUI (reactive data binding)
- NUnit (testing framework mentioned in CLAUDE.md)
- Dependency injection (architectural pattern)

### Conventions Compliance
✅ Follows `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`:
- "Consistent Project Structure": ✅ File structure documented (spec.md lines 224-244, tasks.md lines 327-352)
- "Clear Documentation": ✅ Comprehensive spec with algorithm details, PGN format, integration points
- "Version Control Best Practices": ✅ Spec prepared for feature implementation
- "Testing Requirements": ✅ Testing strategy defined (28-36 tests, performance benchmarks)
- "Dependency Management": ✅ Reuses existing dependencies (Wave 1, Wave 2, infrastructure)

### Backend Standards Compliance
✅ Service-based architecture aligns with backend patterns
✅ Interface-based design for all services (IStanleySteeringService, IPurePursuitService, etc.)
✅ Dependency injection pattern documented (lines 314-322)
✅ Thread safety requirements specified (spec.md line 28, tasks.md 2.5, 3.5)

### Coding Style Compliance
Note: `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md` not provided, but spec follows C# conventions:
✅ Pascal case for service names (StanleySteeringService)
✅ Interface naming with 'I' prefix (IStanleySteeringService)
✅ Clear method names (CalculateSteeringAngle, ResetIntegral)
✅ Descriptive property names (CurrentSteeringAngle, CurrentCrossTrackError)

## Recommendations
None - specification is comprehensive and ready for implementation.

## Conclusion
✅ **Ready for implementation**

The Wave 3 Steering Algorithms specification accurately reflects all user requirements from the Q&A session. All nine questions are properly answered and incorporated into the spec:

1. ✅ Stanley and Pure Pursuit as separate, user-selectable algorithms
2. ✅ Services kept flat in Guidance/ directory (no Steering/ subdirectory)
3. ✅ 100Hz performance target to match MCU steering loop
4. ✅ All tuning parameters exposed via VehicleConfiguration for UI
5. ✅ Look-ahead adaptation based on speed, XTE, curvature, vehicle type
6. ✅ Steering commands sent via PGN over UDP to AutoSteer module
7. ✅ Real-time algorithm switching supported during operation
8. ✅ Edge case testing includes tight curves, U-turns, different vehicles
9. ✅ Nothing explicitly out of scope per user request

**Test Writing Compliance:**
✅ Follows limited testing approach: 4-7 tests per implementation task group, maximum 10 additional tests from testing-engineer, total ~28-36 tests
✅ Test verification runs ONLY newly written tests, not entire suite
✅ No comprehensive/exhaustive testing requirements

**Reusability:**
✅ Properly leverages existing Wave 1 and Wave 2 services
✅ Reuses infrastructure (UdpCommunicationService, VehicleConfiguration, PgnMessage)
✅ Extracts and refactors from existing GuidanceService implementation
✅ All new components are justified with clear reasoning

**Visual Design:**
✅ Both visual mockups analyzed and documented
✅ Design elements (cross-track error line, guidance lines, vehicle heading) properly referenced in spec
✅ UI integration points identified for parameter tuning and algorithm selection

**Architecture:**
✅ Follows user's preferred flat directory structure
✅ Service-based architecture consistent with previous waves
✅ Interface-based design for testability and algorithm switching
✅ Performance requirements clearly specified (100Hz, <10ms per iteration)

No critical issues, no minor issues, no over-engineering concerns. The specification is well-structured, comprehensive, and ready for api-engineer and testing-engineer to begin implementation.
