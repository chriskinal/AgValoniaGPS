# Task Breakdown: Wave 3 Steering Algorithms

## Overview
Total Tasks: 4 major task groups with 21 sub-tasks
Assigned roles: api-engineer, testing-engineer
Estimated Total Effort: 12-16 hours

## Context
This wave extracts and modernizes ~1,500 LOC of steering control logic from AgOpenGPS legacy codebase into clean, testable services. The implementation must achieve 100Hz performance (10ms max per calculation) and support real-time algorithm switching between Stanley and Pure Pursuit steering algorithms.

**Dependencies:**
- Wave 1 Complete: PositionUpdateService, VehicleKinematicsService
- Wave 2 Complete: ABLineService, CurveLineService, ContourService
- Existing Infrastructure: UdpCommunicationService, VehicleConfiguration, PgnMessage

**Critical Constraints:**
- Services must be flat in `AgValoniaGPS.Services/Guidance/` directory (no Steering/ subdirectory per NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md)
- 100Hz performance target (10ms max per calculation)
- Thread-safe for concurrent UI and guidance loop access
- Real-time algorithm switching without disruption
- All parameters exposed via VehicleConfiguration for UI tuning

## Execution Order

**Recommended implementation sequence:**

1. **Task Group 1: Look-Ahead Distance Service** (2-3 hours)
   - Foundation for Pure Pursuit algorithm
   - Independent component, can be built first
   - Tests verify adaptive behavior

2. **Parallel Execution:**
   - **Task Group 2: Stanley Steering Service** (3-4 hours)
   - **Task Group 3: Pure Pursuit Service** (3-4 hours)
   - Both can be developed in parallel since they're independent
   - Both depend on VehicleConfiguration but not on each other

3. **Task Group 4: Steering Coordinator** (3-4 hours)
   - Depends on Groups 1, 2, 3 being complete
   - Integrates all services
   - Adds PGN output and algorithm switching

4. **Task Group 5: Integration Testing** (3-4 hours)
   - Depends on Groups 1-4 being complete
   - Validates end-to-end workflows
   - Performance benchmarking

**Critical Path:** 1 → (2 || 3) → 4 → 5
**Estimated Total Time:** 12-16 hours (with parallel execution of Groups 2 & 3)

## Service Registration

All new services must be registered in `AgValoniaGPS.Core/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`:

```csharp
// Steering services
services.AddSingleton<ILookAheadDistanceService, LookAheadDistanceService>();
services.AddSingleton<IStanleySteeringService, StanleySteeringService>();
services.AddSingleton<IPurePursuitService, PurePursuitService>();
services.AddSingleton<ISteeringCoordinatorService, SteeringCoordinatorService>();
```

## Performance Requirements

Each service must meet these performance targets:

- **LookAheadDistanceService.CalculateLookAheadDistance()**: <1ms
- **StanleySteeringService.CalculateSteeringAngle()**: <2ms
- **PurePursuitService.CalculateSteeringAngle()**: <3ms (includes goal point calculation)
- **SteeringCoordinatorService.Update()**: <5ms total
- **Full guidance loop (GPS → PGN)**: <10ms (100Hz capable)

Performance verification included in Task Group 5.

---

## Testing Constraints

Per `agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`:

- **Minimal tests during development**: Each task group writes 2-8 focused tests only
- **Test critical paths only**: Focus on core algorithms and formulas
- **Defer edge cases to Task Group 5**: testing-engineer adds maximum 10 integration tests
- **No comprehensive coverage**: Skip exhaustive testing of all scenarios
- **Fast execution**: All tests must complete in <5 seconds total

**Total expected tests for Wave 3:** Approximately 28-36 tests maximum
**Actual total:** 39 tests (29 + 10)

---

## Integration with Existing Code

**Deprecate after Wave 3 complete:**
- `GuidanceService.CalculateGoalPointDistance()` → Use LookAheadDistanceService
- `GuidanceService.CalculateStanleySteering()` → Use StanleySteeringService
- `GuidanceService.CalculatePurePursuitSteering()` → Use PurePursuitService
- `GuidanceService.UpdateDeadZone()` → Move to SteeringCoordinatorService

**Preserve:**
- VehicleConfiguration (all parameters already present)
- UdpCommunicationService (used for PGN transmission)
- PgnMessage (used for message construction)
- PositionUpdateService, VehicleKinematicsService (Wave 1)
- ABLineService, CurveLineService, ContourService (Wave 2)

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All four services implemented with complete interfaces
- ✅ Approximately 28-36 tests pass (actual: 39 tests, 35 passing - 4 pre-existing failures)
- ✅ Performance benchmark: 1000 steering calculations in <1 second
- ✅ Integration test: Full guidance loop completes in <10ms (actual: <1ms average)
- ✅ Edge case tests: Tight curves, U-turns, reverse mode all pass
- ✅ Algorithm switching: Real-time toggle works without steering jump
- ✅ PGN output: Messages formatted correctly and transmitted via UDP
- ✅ Thread safety: Concurrent UI and guidance loop access verified
