# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
Wave 3 focuses on implementing steering control algorithms for AgValoniaGPS. This wave depends on Wave 1 (Position & Kinematics) and Wave 2 (Guidance Lines) already being complete.

The three main features to implement are:
1. Stanley Steering Algorithm - Cross-track error and heading error based steering
2. Pure Pursuit Algorithm - Look-ahead point based steering
3. Look-Ahead Distance Calculator - Adaptive look-ahead distance based on speed and conditions

This extracts ~1,500 lines of business logic from the original AgOpenGPS FormGPS/Position.designer.cs and CVehicle.cs files.
