# Wave 5: Field Operations - Task Assignments
# Generated: 2025-10-19
# Strategy: Sequential foundation (Group 1) → Parallel core services (Groups 2-5) → Final integration (Group 6)

    notes: "Foundation service required by all subsequent groups. Must complete before parallel execution."

    parallel_group: "batch_2"
    notes: "Depends on BoundaryManagementService for boundary awareness. Can run parallel with Group 4."

  # SEQUENTIAL: Integration must complete last

    notes: "Final integration tests. Requires all services complete. Includes performance benchmarking."
