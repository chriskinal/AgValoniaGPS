# Task Breakdown: Wave 5 - Field Operations

## Overview
Total Tasks: 6 major task groups with 30 sub-tasks
Assigned roles: api-engineer, testing-engineer
Estimated Total Effort: 20-28 hours

## Context
Wave 5 implements field boundary management, headland processing, automated turn generation, and tram line services. This wave extracts ~2,500 LOC of field operations logic from AgOpenGPS legacy codebase and provides the foundation for field-based operations in the precision agriculture workflow.

**Dependencies:**
- Wave 1 Complete: PositionUpdateService, VehicleKinematicsService
- Wave 2 Complete: ABLineService, CurveLineService, ContourService
- Wave 3 Complete: SteeringCoordinatorService, PurePursuitService, StanleySteeringService
- Wave 4 Complete: SectionControlService, SectionSpeedService, AnalogSwitchStateService
- Existing Infrastructure: UdpCommunicationService, VehicleConfiguration

**Critical Constraints:**
- Services organized in flat `AgValoniaGPS.Services/FieldOperations/` directory per NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md
- Point-in-polygon checks: <1ms per check at 10Hz
- All geometric operations use UTM coordinates internally
- File I/O supports 3 formats: AgOpenGPS .txt, GeoJSON, KML
- EventArgs pattern for all state changes with validation
- Thread-safe for concurrent operations

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
1. PointInPolygonService is foundational - built first for use by all other services
2. BoundaryManagementService provides core boundary operations for HeadlandService
3. UTurnService integrates with Wave 3 SteeringCoordinatorService
4. TramLineService integrates with Wave 2 ABLineService
5. All services subscribe to Wave 1 PositionUpdateService for real-time GPS updates

## Execution Order

**Recommended implementation sequence:**

1. **Task Group 1: PointInPolygonService (Foundation)** (3-4 hours)
   - Must be built first - used by all other services
   - Foundational geometric algorithm
   - R-tree indexing for performance
   - Independent of other Wave 5 services

2. **Task Group 2: BoundaryManagementService** (5-6 hours)
   - Depends on PointInPolygonService for containment checks
   - Provides boundary data for HeadlandService
   - GPS integration with Wave 1 PositionUpdateService
   - Core field operations foundation

3. **Parallel Execution (after Group 2 complete):**
   - **Task Group 3: HeadlandService** (4-5 hours)
     - Depends on Groups 1 & 2
     - Independent of Groups 4 & 5
   - **Task Group 5: TramLineService** (3-4 hours)
     - Depends on Group 1 and Wave 2 ABLineService
     - Independent of Groups 3 & 4
     - Can run parallel with Group 3

4. **Task Group 4: UTurnService** (5-6 hours)
   - Depends on Groups 1 & 2 for boundary/trigger detection
   - Simplified implementation without external service dependencies (per task spec)
   - Build after Groups 1-2 complete, can parallel with Groups 3 & 5

5. **Task Group 6: Integration Testing & Performance Validation** (4-5 hours)
   - Depends on all Groups 1-5 being complete
   - Validates end-to-end workflows
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Cross-wave integration verification

**Critical Path:** 1 â†’ 2 â†’ (3 || 4 || 5) â†’ 6

**Estimated Total Time:** 20-28 hours (with parallel execution of Groups 3, 4, 5 after Group 2)

**Parallelization Opportunities:**
- Groups 3, 4, 5 can run in parallel after Groups 1 & 2 complete
- Each group has minimal interdependencies during this phase
- Group 4 simplified to remove cross-wave dependencies per task spec

## Performance Requirements

Each service must meet these performance targets:

- **PointInPolygonService.IsPointInPolygon()**: <1ms per check (10Hz capable)
- **BoundaryManagementService.SimplifyBoundary()**: <10ms for typical field (50-200 points)
- **HeadlandService.GenerateHeadland()**: <50ms for typical field
- **UTurnService.GenerateTurnPattern()**: <10ms per pattern
- **TramLineService.GenerateTramLines()**: <20ms for 10 lines
- **Real-time area calculation**: No noticeable lag during recording

Performance verification included in Task Group 6.

---

## Testing Constraints

Per `agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`:

- **Minimal tests during development**: Each task group writes 2-8 focused tests only
- **Test critical paths only**: Focus on core algorithms and workflows
- **Defer edge cases to Task Group 6**: testing-engineer adds maximum 10 integration tests
- **No comprehensive coverage**: Skip exhaustive testing of all scenarios
- **Fast execution**: All tests must complete in <10 seconds total

**Total expected tests for Wave 5:** Approximately 43 tests maximum

---

## Integration with Existing Code

**Wave 1 Integration (Position & Kinematics):**
- Subscribe to `PositionUpdateService.PositionUpdated` for boundary recording
- Use `GetCurrentPosition()`, `GetCurrentHeading()`, `GetCurrentSpeed()`
- Access `VehicleKinematicsService` for wheelbase, turn radius calculations

**Wave 2 Integration (Guidance Lines):**
- Access `ABLineService.GetActiveABLine()` for tram line generation
- Reference `ABLineFileService` for consistent file I/O patterns
- Use AB line heading and position for parallel line calculations

**Wave 3 Integration (Steering):**
- Coordinate with `SteeringCoordinatorService.Update()` during turn execution
- Pass turn path waypoints for path following
- Switch between turn path and guidance line steering modes
- Monitor `SteeringUpdated` event for cross-track error

**Wave 4 Integration (Section Control):**
- Call `SectionControlService.PauseAllSections()` when turn starts
- Call `SectionControlService.ResumeAllSections()` when turn completes
- Subscribe to `SectionStateChanged` events for state coordination
- Configurable pause timing based on section response

**Cross-Wave Event Flow Examples:**
```
Boundary Recording:
PositionUpdateService.PositionUpdated
  -> BoundaryManagementService.ProcessPosition()
  -> BoundaryManagementService.PointAdded (event)
  -> BoundaryManagementService.AreaUpdated (event)

Turn Execution:
PositionUpdateService.PositionUpdated
  -> UTurnService.IsTurnTriggered()
  -> UTurnService.TriggerDetected (event)
  -> UTurnService.StartTurn()
  -> SectionControlService.PauseAllSections()
  -> SteeringCoordinatorService.Update(turnPath)
  -> UTurnService.CompleteTurn()
  -> SectionControlService.ResumeAllSections()

Tram Line Generation:
ABLineService.GetActiveABLine()
  -> TramLineService.GenerateTramLines()
  -> TramLineService.TramLinesGenerated (event)
```

## Algorithm Implementation Notes

**Douglas-Peucker Simplification:**
- Recursive divide-and-conquer approach
- Find point with max perpendicular distance from line
- Split if distance > tolerance, recurse on segments
- O(n log n) average, O(nÂ²) worst case

**Shoelace Formula:**
- Area = 0.5 * |Î£(xi * yi+1 - xi+1 * yi)|
- O(n) time, O(1) space
- Works for any non-self-intersecting polygon
- Use UTM coordinates for accuracy

**Ray-Casting (Point-in-Polygon):**
- Cast horizontal ray from point to infinity
- Count edge intersections
- Odd count = inside, even count = outside
- Handle edge cases: on edge, on vertex, horizontal edges

**R-tree Spatial Indexing:**
- Build hierarchical MBR tree for segments
- Query optimization: check only relevant segments
- Use for polygons >500 vertices
- O(log n) query time average

**Offset Polygon (Headlands):**
- Offset each edge perpendicular by distance
- Calculate vertex intersections
- Insert arcs for smooth corners
- Detect and remove self-intersections
- O(nÂ²) for self-intersection detection

**Dubins Path (Turns):**
- Calculate 6 path types: LSL, RSR, LSR, RSL, RLR, LRL
- Select shortest valid path
- Discretize into waypoints
- Map to turn patterns (Question Mark, Semi-Circle, etc.)
