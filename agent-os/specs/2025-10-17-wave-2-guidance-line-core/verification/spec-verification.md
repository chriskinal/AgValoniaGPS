### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check

**Unnecessary New Components:**
NONE DETECTED - All new components are necessary:
- IABLineService/ABLineService: No existing AB line service (spec.md lines 149-152)
- ICurveLineService/CurveLineService: No existing curve service (spec.md lines 154-157)
- IContourService/ContourService: No existing contour service (spec.md lines 159-162)
- Data models (ABLine, CurveLine, ContourLine): Required for guidance line storage
- Events: Required for decoupled architecture per user Q2

**Duplicated Logic:**
NONE DETECTED:
- Position/heading data obtained via method parameters from Wave 1 services (loose coupling per Q11)
- FieldService extended, not duplicated (per user Q8)
- Test patterns reuse existing NUnit infrastructure (spec.md lines 142-145)
- MathNet.Numerics used instead of reimplementing spline algorithms (per user Q6)

**Missing Reuse Opportunities:**
NONE DETECTED:
- Wave 1 services properly referenced for position/heading data
- FieldService extension approach documented
- Existing test patterns referenced
- MathNet.Numerics chosen for curve smoothing instead of custom implementation
- All reusability opportunities from requirements.md are addressed in spec/tasks

**Justification for New Code:**
- New services required: No existing guidance line services exist in AgValoniaGPS (this is logic extraction from AgOpenGPS)
- Improved algorithms: User explicitly requested improving upon AgOpenGPS methods (Q5)
- Modern architecture: User requested DI pattern, event-driven, loosely coupled (Q1, Q2, Q11)

PASSED: No over-engineering detected. All new components justified and necessary.

## Critical Issues
NONE - No critical issues found that would block implementation.

## Minor Issues
NONE - No minor issues identified.

## Over-Engineering Concerns
NONE - Specification is appropriately scoped:
- Three focused services matching user requirements
- Reuses existing infrastructure (FieldService, Wave 1 services)
- Leverages third-party library (MathNet.Numerics) instead of custom implementation
- No unnecessary abstractions or complexity added
- Test coverage appropriate (36-58 focused tests, not exhaustive)

## Recommendations

1. **Performance Benchmarking**: Consider adding specific benchmark tasks using BenchmarkDotNet to validate 20-25 Hz performance target early in implementation (mentioned in tasks.md line 685 but not as explicit task)

2. **Thread Safety Verification**: While thread safety is mentioned in success criteria (spec.md line 577), consider adding explicit task for thread safety testing given concurrent UI/calculation thread access mentioned in spec.md line 83

3. **Migration Testing**: Task Group 8 mentions AgOpenGPS format compatibility, but consider adding explicit test for loading real AgOpenGPS field files to verify backward compatibility works with actual user data

4. **Documentation Examples**: While XML documentation is required, consider adding task for creating code usage examples or sample integration code to help future UI integration (Wave 3)

These recommendations are minor enhancements, not blocking issues.

## Standards Compliance Verification

**Global Coding Style (agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md):**
- Small focused functions: Implied in task descriptions (methods have single responsibilities)
- Meaningful names: Service/interface names are clear and descriptive
- DRY principle: Reusability opportunities documented and leveraged

**Testing Best Practices (agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md):**
PASSED - Specification complies with user's testing standards:
- "Write Minimal Tests During Development": Compliant - each task group writes only 2-8 focused tests
- "Test Only Core User Flows": Compliant - tests focus on critical guidance calculation paths
- "Defer Edge Case Testing": Addressed - edge cases handled in dedicated testing-engineer phase (Task Group 10)
- Testing approach matches standard: Write tests at logical completion points (after each service implementation)

**Tech Stack (agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md):**
- Tech stack file is template only (not filled out for this project)
- Spec uses .NET 8.0, C# 12, NUnit 4.3.2, MathNet.Numerics per project standards
- No conflicts detected

**Conventions:**
- Interface-based design (SOLID principles): Verified in spec.md lines 92-96
- Dependency injection pattern: Verified in tasks.md Task Group 9
- Event-driven architecture: Verified throughout spec and tasks
- No UI framework dependencies: Verified in spec.md line 301, line 569

PASSED: All standards compliance verified.
