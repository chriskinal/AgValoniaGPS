- Q5 (Boundary Integration): New section-specific logic → Fine-grained boundary checking documented (entire section width, not just center)
- Q6 (Manual Override): Auto/Manual modes → SectionState enum includes Auto, ManualOn, ManualOff, Off
- Q7 (WorkSwitch): Separate service → AnalogSwitchStateService documented as separate service

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check
**Status: PASSED - Excellent reuse strategy, no over-engineering detected**

**Unnecessary New Components: NONE**
- All 7 services are new and required (section control domain not in existing codebase)
- No duplicated UI components (spec explicitly excludes GUI implementation)
- No unnecessary abstractions or patterns

**Duplicated Logic: NONE**
- Leverages IVehicleKinematicsService for turning radius (not recreated)
- Leverages IPositionUpdateService for position updates (not recreated)
- Leverages existing Boundary models for intersection (not recreated)
- Reuses text-based file format pattern (not inventing new format)
- Reuses event-driven architecture (not creating new event system)

**Missing Reuse Opportunities: NONE**
- Spec explicitly identifies and leverages all applicable existing patterns
- Service patterns from Waves 1-3 thoroughly documented
- File I/O patterns from existing services referenced
- Event model patterns from ABLine/Curve services used
- Mathematical calculation patterns from VehicleKinematicsService applied

**Justification for New Code:**
- SectionControlService: Section FSM domain logic unique to section control (justified)
- CoverageMapService: Triangle strip spatial tracking not present in existing code (justified)
- SectionSpeedService: Differential section speeds unique calculation (justified)
- AnalogSwitchStateService: Multi-switch management new domain (justified)
- SectionConfigurationService: Section-specific configuration management (justified)
- File services: Section/coverage data persistence unique to this domain (justified)
- All new services have clear, non-duplicated responsibilities

**Appropriate Complexity:**
- FSM for section state: Appropriate for complex state transitions with timers
- Grid-based spatial index: Appropriate for 100k+ triangle overlap queries
- Separate file services: Follows established pattern from guidance services
- 7 services total: Reasonable separation of concerns, each with clear responsibility

**Assessment: NO OVER-ENGINEERING DETECTED - All new components justified and properly leverage existing patterns**

## Critical Issues
**NONE FOUND**

The specification is implementation-ready with no blocking issues.

## Minor Issues
**NONE FOUND**

The specification is comprehensive and well-aligned with requirements.

## Over-Engineering Concerns
**NONE FOUND**

All services are justified, and existing code is properly leveraged.

## Recommendations

### 1. Consider Boundary Service Interface
**Context:** Spec references `IBoundaryService` as dependency for SectionControlService, but doesn't clarify if this service exists from previous waves.

**Recommendation:** Verify that `IBoundaryService` or equivalent exists from Waves 1-3. If not, consider whether boundary intersection logic should be:
- Added to an existing service (e.g., field management service)
- Created as part of Wave 4 (though not mentioned in requirements)
- Implemented directly in SectionControlService using existing Boundary models

**Priority:** Low - Implementation teams can resolve this during development

### 2. Polygon Intersection Algorithm Complexity
**Context:** Spec mentions "polygon-polygon intersection algorithm" and "Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm" for triangle overlap detection.

**Recommendation:** These algorithms can be complex to implement correctly. Consider:
- Referencing existing computational geometry libraries if available in .NET ecosystem
- Providing pseudocode or algorithmic references in spec
- Adding specific test cases for curved boundaries and complex polygon shapes

**Priority:** Low - Testing task group 5 includes edge case testing for curved boundaries

### 3. Spatial Index Performance Trade-offs
**Context:** Spec specifies "grid-based spatial index" for coverage map, mentions R-tree as alternative.

**Recommendation:** Document the rationale for grid-based over R-tree:
- Grid-based: Simpler implementation, predictable performance, good for uniform coverage
- R-tree: Better for non-uniform coverage, more complex implementation
Current choice is appropriate, but explicit rationale would help implementers understand trade-offs.

**Priority:** Very Low - Choice is reasonable and documented

### 4. File Format Versioning
**Context:** Coverage.txt and SectionConfig.txt formats specified, but no versioning mentioned.

**Recommendation:** Consider adding version header to file formats for future compatibility:
```
# AgValoniaGPS Section Control v1.0
```
This allows future format changes without breaking existing files.

**Priority:** Very Low - Can be added during implementation

### 5. Performance Benchmark Automation
**Context:** Spec requires performance benchmarks (<5ms, <2ms, <3ms) but doesn't specify automation.

**Recommendation:** Clarify in testing tasks that performance benchmarks should:
- Run automatically on each build
- Fail CI if thresholds exceeded
- Generate performance reports for tracking over time

**Priority:** Very Low - Testing task group already mentions "Benchmarks run on each build"

## Standards & Preferences Compliance
