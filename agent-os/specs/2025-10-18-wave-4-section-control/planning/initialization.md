# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
Wave 4 implements section control functionality for AgValoniaGPS, including:
- Section state management (on/off control)
- Coverage mapping and tracking
- Section speed calculations
- Boundary-aware section control
- Overlap detection and prevention
- Manual and automatic control modes

This is part of the feature extraction roadmap from AgOpenGPS, specifically Wave 4: Section Control which has HIGH complexity and includes:
1. SectionControlService - Section state machine with boundary checking, look-ahead, and manual overrides
2. CoverageMapService - Coverage recording, area calculation, and patch management
3. SectionSpeedService - Individual section speed calculation based on tool width and turning

Dependencies: Waves 1-3 (Position/Kinematics, Guidance Lines, Steering Algorithms) - all complete

Please initialize the spec folder and save this raw idea.
