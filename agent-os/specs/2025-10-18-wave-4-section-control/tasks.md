## Execution Order & Parallelization Strategy

### Critical Path (Sequential - Must Complete in Order)
1. **Task Group 1: Foundation** (api-engineer) - MUST complete first ✅ COMPLETE
   - All other tasks depend on models/enums/events
   - Estimated time: 2-4 hours

### Parallel Phase 1 (After Task Group 1)
2. **Task Group 2: Leaf Services** (api-engineer) - Can run in parallel with Task Group 3 ✅ COMPLETE
   - No service dependencies
   - Estimated time: 3-5 hours
3. **Task Group 3: Dependent Services** (api-engineer) - Can run in parallel with Task Group 2 ✅ COMPLETE
   - Depends on Task Group 1 only (models/enums)
   - Estimated time: 4-6 hours

### Sequential Phase 2 (After Task Groups 2 & 3)
4. **Task Group 4: File I/O** (api-engineer) - MUST wait for Task Groups 2 & 3 ✅ COMPLETE
   - Depends on all services being complete
   - Estimated time: 2-3 hours

### Final Phase (After All Implementation)
5. **Task Group 5: Testing** (testing-engineer) - MUST wait for all implementation ✅ COMPLETE
   - Reviews all existing tests
   - Fills critical gaps only
   - Estimated time: 3-4 hours

**Total Estimated Time:** 14-22 hours
**Parallelization Benefit:** 2-3 hours saved by running Task Groups 2 & 3 in parallel

---

## Risk Areas & Mitigation

### High Risk Areas

**1. Performance Targets (<10ms total loop)**
- Risk: Complex calculations may exceed time budget
- Mitigation:
  * Optimize spatial indexing in CoverageMapService (grid-based, not R-tree)
  * Profile early with performance benchmarks
  * Pre-allocate arrays, minimize allocations in hot paths
  * Consider parallel processing for section speed calculations if needed

**2. Thread Safety**
- Risk: Concurrent access from GPS thread, UI thread, file I/O thread
- Mitigation:
  * Use lock objects consistently (pattern from PositionUpdateService)
  * Test concurrent access scenarios in Task Group 5
  * Verify event subscription/publication thread safety
  * Use thread-safe collections where appropriate

**3. Namespace Collisions**
- Risk: `Section/` directory conflicts with future `Section` model class
- Mitigation:
  * NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md explicitly approves `Section/` directory name
  * No `Section` class exists in AgValoniaGPS.Models (verified)
  * Models are: `SectionConfiguration`, `SectionState`, `CoverageTriangle`, etc.
  * Follow functional area naming (Section = functional area, not domain object)

**4. File Format Compatibility**
- Risk: Incompatibility with AgOpenGPS file formats
- Mitigation:
  * Use text-based formats matching AgOpenGPS patterns
  * Test round-trip save/load with real AgOpenGPS files if available
  * Document any format deviations clearly

**5. Boundary Intersection Accuracy**
- Risk: Incorrect polygon-polygon intersection calculations
- Mitigation:
  * Reuse existing boundary intersection code if available
  * Test with curved boundaries, complex polygons
  * Verify look-ahead anticipation prevents late turn-offs

### Medium Risk Areas

**6. Coverage Map Memory Usage**
- Risk: 100k+ triangles may consume excessive memory
- Mitigation:
  * Use struct for CoverageTriangle (value type, stack allocation)
  * Consider compression for file storage
  * Monitor memory usage in performance benchmarks

**7. Timer Management Complexity**
- Risk: Turn-on/turn-off timers with cancellation may have bugs
- Mitigation:
  * Use System.Threading.Timer or Task.Delay with CancellationToken
  * Test timer scenarios thoroughly in Task Group 3
  * Verify timer cancellation doesn't leak resources

**8. Event Subscription Lifecycle**
- Risk: Memory leaks from event subscriptions
- Mitigation:
  * Follow IDisposable pattern for services
  * Unsubscribe from events in Dispose methods
  * Use weak event patterns if necessary
