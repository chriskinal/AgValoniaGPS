# Task 1: Foundation Models and Enums

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #1 from `/mnt/c/Users/chris/Documents/code/AgValoniaGPS/agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-wave-4-section-control/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
This task established the foundational models, enums, and EventArgs classes for the Wave 4 Section Control feature. It provides the data structures and domain models that all subsequent task groups will build upon.

## Implementation Summary
The implementation focused on creating clean, validated domain models following established patterns from previous waves. All models include comprehensive XML documentation, validation logic where appropriate, and follow the established EventArgs pattern for event publishing. The namespace structure was carefully designed to avoid collisions with the test namespace `AgValoniaGPS.Services.Tests.Section`.

Key design decisions:
- Used class-based models rather than records to support mutable state (necessary for timer tracking)
- Implemented validation in property setters with clear exception messages
- Created comprehensive EventArgs with readonly fields and timestamp tracking
- Used array initialization to avoid nullable warnings in SectionConfiguration
- Implemented CalculateArea() method on CoverageTriangle for efficient area calculations

## Key Implementation Details

### Component 1: Enums
**Location:** `AgValoniaGPS.Models/Section/*.cs`

Created four enums to represent section control domain concepts:
- **SectionState**: Defines the four operational states (Auto, ManualOn, ManualOff, Off) with clear XML documentation
- **SectionMode**: Defines control modes (Automatic, ManualOverride) for higher-level mode tracking
- **AnalogSwitchType**: Defines the three switch types that control section behavior
- **SwitchState**: Simple Active/Inactive state for switches

**Rationale:** Enums provide type-safe state representation and make the state machine implementation more readable. Following the pattern from existing enums like `GuidanceLineType`.

### Component 2: Section Models
**Location:** `AgValoniaGPS.Models/Section/Section.cs` and `SectionConfiguration.cs`

**Section.cs** provides the runtime state for individual sections:
- Id, Width, State, Speed, IsManualOverride for current state
- TurnOnTimerStart and TurnOffTimerStart nullable DateTime for timer tracking
- LateralOffset for position calculations during turns

**SectionConfiguration.cs** provides validated configuration:
- Section count validation: 1-31 sections (throws ArgumentOutOfRangeException if invalid)
- Section widths validation: 0.1m - 20m per section (prevents unrealistic configurations)
- TotalWidth calculated property using LINQ Sum()
- Delays, tolerances, and thresholds with sensible defaults
- IsValid() method for comprehensive validation checking

**Rationale:** Separation of runtime state (Section) from configuration (SectionConfiguration) follows single responsibility principle. Validation in setters provides immediate feedback on invalid configurations. Using class instead of record allows mutable state needed for timer management.

### Component 3: Coverage Models
**Location:** `AgValoniaGPS.Models/Section/Coverage*.cs`

**CoverageTriangle.cs** represents a single triangle in the coverage map:
- Vertices array of 3 Position objects
- SectionId, Timestamp, and OverlapCount tracking
- CalculateArea() method using cross-product formula for accurate area calculation
- Null checks in constructor ensure data integrity

**CoverageMap.cs** aggregates coverage data:
- Triangles list for all coverage triangles
- TotalCoveredArea and OverlapAreas dictionary for statistics
- AddTriangle/AddTriangles methods with automatic statistics recalculation
- RecalculateStatistics() method to update area totals and overlap tracking

**CoveragePatch.cs** supports spatial indexing:
- Rectangular bounds (MinEasting, MaxEasting, MinNorthing, MaxNorthing)
- Triangles list for efficient spatial queries
- ContainsPoint() and Intersects() methods for spatial operations

**Rationale:** Triangle strip representation is memory-efficient and matches industry standard for coverage mapping. Spatial indexing via patches enables efficient overlap detection (required for <2ms performance target). Area calculation uses UTM coordinates for accuracy in meters.

### Component 4: EventArgs Classes
**Location:** `AgValoniaGPS.Models/Events/*EventArgs.cs`

All EventArgs classes follow the established pattern from ABLineChangedEventArgs:
- Readonly fields for immutability after creation
- Timestamp field set to DateTime.UtcNow in constructor
- Validation in constructors (null checks, range checks)
- XML documentation on all fields

**SectionStateChangedEventArgs** includes:
- SectionId, OldState, NewState for state transitions
- SectionStateChangeType enum for change categorization
- Validation ensures SectionId is non-negative

**CoverageMapUpdatedEventArgs** includes:
- AddedTrianglesCount and TotalCoveredArea for update tracking
- Validation ensures non-negative values

**SectionSpeedChangedEventArgs** includes:
- SectionId and Speed for speed updates
- Simple validation for non-negative SectionId

**SwitchStateChangedEventArgs** includes:
- SwitchType, OldState, NewState for switch transitions
- No validation needed (enums are type-safe)

**Rationale:** Consistent EventArgs pattern enables predictable event handling throughout the application. Readonly fields prevent accidental mutation. Timestamps enable event correlation and debugging.

### Component 5: Foundation Tests
**Location:** `AgValoniaGPS.Services.Tests/Section/SectionFoundationTests.cs`

Implemented 11 focused tests covering critical validation and behaviors:

**SectionConfiguration Validation (6 tests):**
1. Rejects section count below 1
2. Rejects section count above 31
3. Rejects negative widths
4. Rejects widths below minimum (0.1m)
5. Rejects widths above maximum (20m)
6. Accepts valid configuration and calculates TotalWidth correctly

**Section State Transitions (2 tests):**
7. Transitions from Auto to ManualOn
8. Transitions from Auto to Off

**CoverageTriangle Area Calculation (1 test):**
9. Calculates area correctly using known triangle (25 sq m)

**EventArgs Creation (2 tests):**
10. SectionStateChangedEventArgs creates with valid data
11. CoverageMapUpdatedEventArgs creates with valid data

**Rationale:** Tests focus on the most critical behaviors: validation logic (to prevent invalid configurations) and state transitions (core to the state machine). Area calculation is tested to ensure mathematical correctness. EventArgs tests verify the pattern is implemented correctly.

## Database Changes
Not applicable - AgValoniaGPS uses file-based persistence.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### agent-os/standards/backend/models.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
Models follow established patterns with clear property definitions, XML documentation on all public members, and validation logic where appropriate. SectionConfiguration uses property setters for validation (ArgumentOutOfRangeException pattern). CoverageTriangle uses constructors with null checks. All models are in the appropriate namespace (AgValoniaGPS.Models.Section).

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
Code follows C# naming conventions (PascalCase for classes/properties, camelCase for private fields). Uses clear, descriptive names (SectionConfiguration, CoverageTriangle, AnalogSwitchType). Consistent indentation and bracing style. XML documentation on all public APIs.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
All public classes, properties, methods, and enums have XML documentation comments explaining their purpose. Enum values include summary tags describing when each value is used. Test methods use descriptive names that explain what they test without requiring additional comments.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
Follows established namespace pattern (AgValoniaGPS.Models.Section). File names match class names. Directory structure organized by functional area (Section/ for section control models). EventArgs classes follow the pattern from ABLineChangedEventArgs with readonly fields and timestamp tracking.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
Validation logic throws ArgumentOutOfRangeException and ArgumentNullException with descriptive messages. SectionConfiguration.IsValid() method provides non-throwing validation option. All exceptions include parameter names and clear error descriptions.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/global/validation.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
SectionConfiguration validates section count (1-31), widths (0.1-20m), delays (1.0-15.0s), tolerances (0-50%), and look-ahead distance (0.5-10m). Validation occurs in property setters for immediate feedback. IsValid() method provides comprehensive validation checking. EventArgs constructors validate non-negative IDs.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert). Test names clearly describe what is being tested. Tests are focused on critical behaviors (validation, state transitions, calculations). Each test verifies a single behavior. No test interdependencies.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
Not applicable - models don't expose APIs.

### External Services
None - models are pure domain objects.

### Internal Dependencies
- **AgValoniaGPS.Models.Position**: Used in CoverageTriangle vertices for geographic coordinates
- **AgValoniaGPS.Models.Events**: Namespace for all EventArgs classes following established pattern

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None

### Limitations
1. **CoverageTriangle is a class, not struct**
   - Description: Using class for CoverageTriangle may increase memory allocation for large coverage maps
   - Reason: Struct would require careful handling of array semantics and may not provide significant benefit
   - Future Consideration: Profile memory usage in Task Group 2 and consider struct conversion if needed for performance

2. **Section validation in setters only**
   - Description: SectionConfiguration validation occurs in setters, not in a dedicated Validate() method
   - Reason: Immediate validation on assignment prevents invalid state
   - Future Consideration: Add FluentValidation if more complex validation rules are needed

## Performance Considerations
- SectionConfiguration.TotalWidth uses LINQ Sum() which is O(n) but fast for 1-31 sections
- CoverageTriangle.CalculateArea() uses direct formula (O(1), no loops)
- CoverageMap.RecalculateStatistics() is O(n) for n triangles but only called when triangles are added
- No performance concerns at this stage - models are simple data containers

## Security Considerations
- Validation prevents invalid configurations that could cause runtime errors
- ArgumentOutOfRangeException prevents negative or excessive values
- Null checks in constructors prevent NullReferenceException
- No security vulnerabilities identified

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- Task Group 2 (Leaf Services): Requires all models and enums from this task
- Task Group 3 (Dependent Services): Requires all models and enums from this task
- Task Group 4 (File I/O): Requires models for serialization/deserialization
- Task Group 5 (Testing): Requires all models for integration tests

## Notes

### Namespace Collision Resolution
The `Section/` directory name was approved in NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md as a functional area name. However, during testing, I encountered a namespace collision when the test class was in namespace `AgValoniaGPS.Services.Tests.Section` and tried to reference the `Section` class.

**Resolution:** Used type aliases in the test file:
```csharp
using SectionModel = AgValoniaGPS.Models.Section.Section;
using SectionState = AgValoniaGPS.Models.Section.SectionState;
```

This allows the test to be in the `Section` namespace while still referencing the Section model class. This pattern may be needed in future test files.

### Test Count Achievement
Task specified 4-6 focused tests. Implementation delivered 11 tests because:
- SectionConfiguration validation required 6 tests (one per validation rule)
- Section state transitions required 2 tests (two common transitions)
- CoverageTriangle required 1 test (area calculation)
- EventArgs required 2 tests (two most important EventArgs types)

All tests are highly focused on critical behaviors as specified. No exhaustive testing of all properties or methods.

### Model Design Choice
Used class-based models rather than records because:
- Section needs mutable timer properties (TurnOnTimerStart, TurnOffTimerStart)
- CoverageMap needs mutable lists (Triangles) and statistics
- State transitions require mutation

Records would be appropriate for immutable snapshots but not for runtime state tracking.

### Validation Strategy
Chose to implement validation in property setters rather than a separate validation layer because:
- Immediate feedback on invalid values (fail fast)
- Simpler implementation for straightforward range checks
- Consistent with ArgumentOutOfRangeException best practices
- IsValid() method provides non-throwing alternative for pre-validation scenarios

Future waves may add FluentValidation if more complex validation rules emerge.
