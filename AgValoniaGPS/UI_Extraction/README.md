## Viewing the Documentation

### On GitHub (Recommended)
GitHub natively renders Mermaid diagrams! Just click any `.md` file above.

### Interactive HTML
Download `ui-documentation.html` and open in any browser for:
- Real-time search across all forms
- Expandable form details
- Color-coded complexity indicators
- Navigation relationship table
- Statistics dashboard

### JSON Data
`ui-structure.json` contains the raw extracted data for programmatic access:
- 74 forms with complete metadata
- 10,774 controls with properties
- 670 event handlers with descriptions
- Navigation graph and structure analysis

## Extraction Statistics

**Successfully extracted from 74 forms:**
- 52 Menu Items
- 8 Toolbar Buttons
- 10,774 Controls
- 670 Event Handlers
- 47 State Variables
- 4 Images
- 1 String Resource

**Navigation & Structure:**
- 16 Form Navigations
- 64 Entry Points (forms with no parents)
- 8 Forms with Children
- 6 Complex Forms Analyzed (>500 controls each)

**Migration Effort Estimate:**
- Complex Forms (>500 controls): 6 forms × 40-80 hours = 240-480 hours
- Moderate Forms (100-500): 15 forms × 8-20 hours = 120-300 hours
- Simple Forms (<100): 53 forms × 2-4 hours = 106-212 hours
- **Total: 466-992 hours**

## Form Complexity Breakdown

| Complexity | Control Count | Forms | Percentage |
|------------|--------------|-------|------------|
| 🔴 Complex | >500 | 6 | 8% |
| 🟡 Moderate | 100-500 | 15 | 20% |
| 🟢 Simple | <100 | 53 | 72% |

## Top 5 Most Complex Forms

1. **FormConfig** - 2,133 controls (Configuration settings)
2. **FormSteerWiz** - 1,299 controls (Auto steer wizard)
3. **FormAllSettings** - 1,080 controls (Settings summary)
4. **FormSteer** - 900 controls (Auto steer configuration)
5. **FormGPS** - 720 controls (Main window with 52 menu items)

## How This Was Generated

This documentation was automatically generated by the **AgOpenGPS UI Extractor** tool:

**5-Phase Extraction Process:**
1. **Phase 1**: Static UI structure from `*.Designer.cs` files (Roslyn parsing)
2. **Phase 2**: Dynamic behavior from `*.cs` code-behind (event handlers, state variables)
3. **Phase 3**: Resources from `*.resx` files (images, strings)
4. **Phase 4**: Navigation analysis and form structure patterns
5. **Phase 5**: Documentation generation (Mermaid, migration guide, HTML)

**Tool Location:** `/Tools/AgOpenGPS.UIExtractor/`

## Next Steps

1. Review the **[Migration Guide](AVALONIA-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md)** for planning
2. Check the **[Navigation Graph](navigation-graph.md)** to understand application flow
3. Review **[Complex Form Diagrams](form-structure-FormConfig.md)** for refactoring opportunities
4. Use the **Interactive HTML** for detailed exploration
5. Reference the migration guide's control mappings during implementation
